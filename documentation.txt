-	Dominant Face:
	-	Step in first in the frame
	-	Tiebreaker: Prefers larger face

-	Detection:
	-	Library: OpenCV
	-	Pre-trained faceCascade (Haar feature-based cascade)
	-	Runs in a while loop if no face is being tracked

-	Tracking:
	-	Library: dlib
	-	When face is detected, a correlation tracker is associated with the frame section to update the position

-	Recognition:
	-	Library: Azure (API Call)
	-	When frame is detected for the first time (or after losing the tracking), the section of the frame with the face is cropped and uploaded to Azure.
		Azure returns with the person id and the confidence level.
	-	Confidence switch:
		-	>80: Very high confidence
		-	>70: High confidence
		-	>50: Moderate confidence
		-	>40: Low confidence (name not shown)
